### [Unique Binary Tree Requirements](https://geeksforgeeks.org/problems/unique-binary-tree-requirements/1)

## Explanation:
Sure, let's break down the logic of the code and its time and space complexity.

## Code Logic

1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class named `Solution`. In C++, a **class** is a user-defined data type that we can use to create objects of this type. It acts as a blueprint for the object we will create.

2. **Function Declaration**: Inside the `Solution` class, a public function named `isPossible` is declared. The **public** keyword means this function can be accessed from outside the class. The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`.

3. **Function Logic**: The function `isPossible` checks if exactly one of `a` or `b` is equal to 2. This is done using the XOR operator (`^`), which returns `true` if exactly one of its operands is `true`, and `false` otherwise. 

    - If `a` is 2 and `b` is not 2, `(a == 2) ^ (b == 2)` will be `true ^ false`, which is `true`.
    - If `a` is not 2 and `b` is 2, `(a == 2) ^ (b == 2)` will be `false ^ true`, which is also `true`.
    - If both `a` and `b` are 2, `(a == 2) ^ (b == 2)` will be `true ^ true`, which is `false`.
    - If neither `a` nor `b` is 2, `(a == 2) ^ (b == 2)` will be `false ^ false`, which is `false`.

4. **Return Statement**: The result of the XOR operation is returned by the function. This will be `true` if exactly one of `a` or `b` is 2, and `false` otherwise.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the function is **O(1)**, which means it takes a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size. This is because the function performs a fixed number of operations (two comparisons and one XOR operation), which does not change with the size of the input.

### `Space Complexity`:
 The space complexity of the function is also **O(1)**, which means it uses a constant amount of memory, regardless of the input size. This is because the function does not use any data structures that grow with the size of the input. It only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input parameters `a` and `b`.

## Code:
```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    bool isPossible(int a, int b)
    {
        return (a == 2) ^ (b == 2);
    }
};
```
